Latest Test: March 12, 2013

VERSIONS IN PLAY
* Eclipse: Juno Service Release 1
* AWS Java SDK: 1.4.0
* Eucalyptus: 3.3 Milestone 3


What currently works:
* View instances, their status and public IP
* View, create, delete Volumes
* View, create and delete Snapshots
* View, create, modify and delete Security Groups

Remaining issues:

* Regarding Images: Image list is always blank.
* Regarding Instances: Cannot start, stop, terminate, copy public DNS name, attach/detach volumes.
* Regarding Instance Metadata: These columns are unexpectedly blank: State, Type, Availability Zone, Key Pair, Launch Time, Security Groups, Tags.
* Simply viewing the instance list gets you an NPE. I mean the list appears, but something broke here because  the pop-up menu that should appear when selecting an instance doesn't even show. And selecting an instance from the list causes an "Unhandled event loop exception" in the ec2 UI code.
* Cannot connect to Walrus, thus now S3 capabilities. This is a known issue and expected to be resolved by the time Eucalyptus 3.3 is released.
