Filesystems generated by image creation tools such as ami-creator are often made quite small by default, to ensure that they can be used on Eucalyptus systems with vm types allocating as little as 2 GB for the root disk.  If you have one of these image files (such as the one created by the FastStart install) and you simply want a larger version, here's how you do that:

Let's say your image is ks-centos6-201302151307.img and you want to grow it to ~9.5G (the largest that will work on a 10GB vm type in eucalyptus, since 512 MB will be swap).  

1. Resize the file: `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M seek=9500 count=1 of=ks-centos6-201302151307.img`
2. Resize the filesystem contained in the file: `resize2fs ks-centos6-201302151307.img`
3. Bundle the image (using the same eki and eri that the original image used; use euca-describe-images to determine this):
```
euca-bundle-image --kernel eki-74C34082 --ramdisk eri-DAB1400A -i ks-centos6-201302151307.img
```
4. Upload: `euca-upload-bundle -b centos6bigger -m /tmp/ks-centos6-201302151307.img.manifest.xml`
5. Register: `euca-register centos6bigger/ks-centos6-201302151307.img.manifest.xml`

That's it.  Your new, larger image is ready to run.
