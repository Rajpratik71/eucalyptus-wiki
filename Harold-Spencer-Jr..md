Hi, my name is Harold Spencer, Jr. ([@hspencer77](https://twitter.com/hspencer77) or [my blog](http://blogs.mindspew-age.com)).  I work as part of the Support team for Eucalyptus Systems, Inc.  Besides doing Tier 3 Support for Eucalyptus, I also work on the following:

* various types of cloud administration scenarios with Eucalyptus and/or AWS
* help contribute to the [eutester project](http://eucalyptus.github.com/eutester/)
* help contribute to [AppScale project](https://github.com/AppScale)

I have been with Eucalyptus now for over 2 and a half years.  Before this, I worked at California State University Northridge in the Pioneering Technology Group.  I really enjoy cloud computing and I really enjoy open source! :-)
