I'm an engineer and involved in several partner integration efforts. Currently, I'm doing a lot of work on the eucalyptus/eucalyptus-ui project.

  * House renovations has become a hobby of mine.
  * I'm fond of hardware hacking and when I can find time, I play with arduinos, raspberryPi, or whatever I can get my hands on.
  * I like Crossfit, volleyball, ultimate and running (when the others haven't made me run too much).
  * I like cats.
