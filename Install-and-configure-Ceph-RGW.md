This task assumes that a Ceph storage cluster is available and Ceph RGW is being installed on CentOS. To install and configure Ceph itself, refer to <link here>. The following instructions are derived from Ceph and RedHat docs. Some steps were either modified or skipped as necessary for integration with Eucalyptus.


## Step-by-step guide
* [Ceph user setup](#ceph-user-setup)
* [Webserver configuration](#webserver-configuration)
* [radosgw user setup](#radosgw-user-setup)
* [radosgw: Get users list and info about existing user](#radosgw:-get-users-list-and-info-about-existing-user)
* [radosgw: Modify user e.g change max bucket](#radosgw:-modify-user-e.g-change-max-bucket)



### Ceph user setup
ceph-radosgw daemon runs on the gateway host and requires a Ceph user for authenticating with the storage cluster. Execute the following commands fromone of the monitors or the admin node from where ceph-deploy was run. Credentials with sufficient priveleges such as ceph.client.admin.keyringare required to run these commands


1. Create a new (empty) keyring file


```
# ceph-authtool --create-keyring ceph.client.radosgw.keyring
```

1. Ceph username must match the name of the ceph-radosgw instance in ceph.conf (explained in web server configuration section). If they don't match ceph-radosgw service won't start up correctly. For instance, if ceph-radosgw service is installed on host xyz, the username assigned to it should be of in the formatclient.radosgw.xyz


```
# ceph-authtool ceph.client.radosgw.keyring -n client.radosgw.xyz --gen-key
```

1. Add capabilities to the key. Capabilities are privilegesto read, write and execute over osds and monitors


```
# ceph-authtool -n client.radosgw.xyz --cap osd 'allow rwx' --cap mon 'allow rwx' ceph.client.radosgw.keyring
```

1. So far a key was generated and had some privileges assigned to it, but its still not associated with the Ceph cluster. Now add the key to the cluster


```
# ceph auth add client.radosgw.xyz -i ceph.client.radosgw.keyring
```



### Webserver configuration
radosgw requires a web server for processing HTTP requests. There are two options available here - civetweb and apache with fastcgi. civitweb is a light weight web server that ships with radosgw and does not need any further installation. For using apache and fastcgi Ceph specific apache and fastcgi packages (support for 100 continue) need to be installed and configured. Although we have not compared/evaluated performance characteristics of the different web servers, I would recommend going with civetweb due to its ease of installation and configuration

Civetweb (Recommended)Ceph version 0.94.6 from Ceph [http://download.ceph.com/rpm-hammer/el6/x86_64/](http://download.ceph.com/rpm-hammer/el6/x86_64/)

    1. Create the default socket directory for Ceph/var/run/cephand assign the ownership to userapache.radosgw init scripts run radosgw as the userapacheand can't create socket under/var/run/cephif its owned by another user


```
# mkdir -p /var/run/ceph
# chmod apache:apache /var/run/ceph
```

    1. Change the ownership of/var/log/ceph/radosgw.logtoapachefor the same reasons as above


```
# chown apache:apache /var/log/ceph/radosgw.log 
```


    
1. Restart httpd and ceph-radosgw services


```
# service restart httpd
# service restart ceph-radosgw
```



### radosgw user setup
A radosgw user has an access key and secret key, much like an IAM account. Since radosgw service is an S3 compatible API, any end user interaction with the service requires these keys. radosgw user is entirely different from the Ceph user management. Create a radosgw user and save the output. Eucalyptus will need the access and secret keys for interacting with radosgw


```
# radosgw-admin user create --uid={username} --display-name="{display-name}"
Â 
{ "user_id": "username",
  "display_name": "display-name",
  "email": "",
  "suspended": 0,
