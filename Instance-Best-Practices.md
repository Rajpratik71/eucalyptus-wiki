The goal of this wiki entry is to document best practices for creating images, and using instances in a secure manner on hybrid (e.g. AWS and Eucalyptus) and on-premise cloud environments.  Additional information can be found in the [Instance Best Practices](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-overview.html) documentation provided by Amazon Web Services. 

### Image Creation

Security starts at the foundation.  Since all instances are based off of images, implementing any type of security is helpful in securing instances.  Below are a list of things that can be done to add additional security during image creation:

* Enabled [PAM](http://www.linux-pam.org/) to help control authentication.
* Enable [Selinux](http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) or [Apparmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page).  Additional resources are below:
  * [Redhat Enterprise Linux 6 Security-Enhanced Linux](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/)
  * [CentOS 5 Deployment Guide - Security and Selinux](http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/selg-overview.html)
  * [Documentation - Apparmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Documentation)
  * [AppArmor - Ubuntu Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor)
  * [openSUSE 12.3 - Introducing AppArmor](http://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/html/openSUSE/opensuse-security/cha.apparmor.intro.html)
* Turn off password-based authentication.  This can be done - along with enabling PAM authentication for ssh - by enabling the following options in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
```
* Encourage non-root access by providing a user that has the ability to have root privileges using [sudo](http://www.sudo.ws/). For example, Amazon AMI Linux images have the "ec2-user" user and Ubuntu Cloud images have the "ubuntu" user.
* Lock down passwords of the root and non-root default users on the image.  This can be done by executing "passwd -l <user-id>".  _NOTE: Some Linux distributions will lock the account when using this command.  If this is the case, please leverage PAM and/or create random password for the accounts.  A clever way of accomplishing this is by using dd:_ 
```
dd if=/dev/urandom count=50|md5sum|passwd --stdin <user-id>
```
* Always delete the shell history before bundling. If you attempt more than one bundle upload in the same image, the shell history contains your secret access key.
* Bundling a running instance requires your private key and X.509 certificate. Put these and other credentials in a location that is not bundled (e.g. when using [euca-bundle-vol](http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/euca2ools/3.0/euca2ools-guide/euca-bundle-vol.html#euca-bundle-vol), pass the folder location where the certificates are stored as part of the values for the -e option).  AWS provides more in-depth information here regarding [what things should be considered when creating a shared AMI (EMI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-sharingamis.html).
* (Optional) By default, all images registered have private launch permissions.  Use [euca-modify-image-attribute](http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/euca2ools/3.0/euca2ools-guide/euca-modify-image-attribute.html#euca-modify-image-attribute) to limit the accounts that can access the image.
* (Optional) Install [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) in the image to help control root and non-root access. If cloud-init isn't available, using a [custom /etc/rc.local](https://github.com/eucalyptus/Eucalyptus-Scripts/blob/master/rc-ec2user.local) script can be used.
* (Optional) Zero-out any unused space on the image.  This can be accomplished with tools like [zerofree](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/zerofree.8.html).
* (Optional) Edit /etc/rc.local to clear out the swap every time the instance is booted.  This can be done by the following command: 
```
sync && /sbin/sysctl vm.drop_caches=3 && swapoff -a && swapon -a
```
* (Optional) Edit /etc/rc.local to zero-out the ephemeral disk (this is usually /dev/vda2) on boot. This will add some additional time to the instance being fully ready to be used.  _NOTE: After zeroing out the ephemeral space, the ephemeral store will need to be formatted with a filesystem (e.g. mkfs.ext3 /dev/vda2)_.

### Instance Security

After locking down the image by using the steps above, additional steps can be done to further secure the instance.  Below are some examples:

* Restrict access by only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on your instance. Controlling access can be accomplished by using [euca-authorize](http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/euca2ools/3.0/euca2ools-guide/euca-authorize.html#euca-authorize) and [euca-revoke](http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/euca2ools/3.0/euca2ools-guide/euca-revoke.html#euca-revoke).  Review the rules in your security groups regularly, and ensure that you apply the principle of least privilegeâ€”only open up permissions that you require. You can also create different security groups to deal with instances that have different security requirements. Consider creating a [bastion](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bastion) security group that allows external logins and keep the remainder of your instances in a group that does not allow external logins.
* Consider using Eucalyptus IAM policies to control access to resources.  For example, providing a policy that restricts access coming from a source IP and/or specific Eucalyptus IAM account can be leveraged by using certain IAM EC2-specific keys.  For more information, please check out the [IAM Policy Elements Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AccessPolicyLanguage_ElementDescriptions.html#AvailableKeys).
* When using a highly-available instance with [Eucalyptus AutoScaling](http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.3/user-guide/autoscaling_overview.html#autoscaling_overview), use an AutoScaling group of 1.  Also refer to [AWS AutoScaling documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/WorkingWithASG.html) as well for additional information.

As mentioned before, this is an effort to help provide a centralized document for instance security best practices.  Any feedback/suggestions/ideas are greatly appreciated.
