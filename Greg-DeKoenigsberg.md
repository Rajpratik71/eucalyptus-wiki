Hi!  I'm Greg.  I'm the community guy for Eucalyptus Systems.

Some fun facts about me:

* I worked at Red Hat from 2001 to 2010.  In that time I was an engineering manager, an early leader of the Fedora Project, the voice of Shadowman for Red Hat Magazine, a liaison to the One Laptop Per Child project, and lots of stuff in-between.

* I thought I was going to be a writer when I grew up.  Know what a writer is?  An actor who's too lazy to wait tables.  Turns out there was more money in computers.  Go figure.

* I am a rabid hockey fan, and one day hope to play in the annual Carolina Hurricanes charity game.  To do that, I need more money and the ability to skate for more than 30 seconds at a time, so I continue to work on both of these things.

* I am the go-to guy for all issues Eucalyptus + OpenShift.
