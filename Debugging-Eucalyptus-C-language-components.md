# Debugging Eucalyptus C-language components (CC and NC)

CC and NC can be debugged using gdb, which can be:

* used to analyze a core dump,
* attached to a live Apache process hosting CC or NC, 
* used to start CC or NC under a debugger from the very beginning.

Each approach will be discussed in turn. 

> The commands below assume that `$EUCALYPTUS` is set to the root of Eucalyptus installation: typically just `/` for package-based installs and often `/opt/eucalyptus` for from-source installations.

## Core dump

Core dumps are useful when a SEGFAULT is difficult to trigger manually, especially on CC, which does a lot of forking.  You know your CC or NC is segfaulting when `httpd-[cc|nc]_error_log` contains lines similar to:

```bash
[Wed Aug 29 14:41:07 2012] [notice] child pid 22520 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
[Wed Aug 29 14:41:13 2012] [notice] child pid 22555 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
[Wed Aug 29 14:41:19 2012] [notice] child pid 22579 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
```

To ensure that CC produces a core dump, you'll need to add the following line

```bash
echo "CoreDumpDirectory /tmp" >>$EUCALYPTUS/etc/eucalyptus/httpd-cc.conf
```

at the end of `create_httpd_config()` function in `$EUCALYPTUS/etc/init.d/eucalyptus-cc`. For NC do the same with 'nc' instead of 'cc' in the paths above. For the changes to take effect, stop the component, increase the core limit (in case it is too low), and start the component again. 

```bash
$EUCALYPTUS/etc/init.d/eucalyptus-cc stop
ulimit -c unlimited
$EUCALYPTUS/etc/init.d/eucalyptus-cc start
```
After that the error in the log should change to:

```bash
[Wed Aug 29 15:39:53 2012] [notice] child pid 6926 exit signal Segmentation fault (11), possible coredump in /tmp
```
And the `/tmp` directory should contain the core dump that can be brought up in `gdb`:

```bash
gdb /usr/sbin/httpd /tmp/core.9895
....
Core was generated by `/usr/sbin/httpd -f /opt/eucalyptus/etc/eucalyptus/httpd-nc.conf'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

(gdb)
```

## Attach gdb to a Eucalyptus component

Attaching to a running instance of the component is often sufficient to examine its memory state or to catch a reproducible SEGFAULT with the debugger attached. The difficulty has to do with deciding which process to attach to and how to ensure the debugger follows the forks you want. Component log files `cc.log` and `nc.log` may reveal to you the PID of the thread of control that you are looking for. 

NC is easier to debug as in steady state it only consists of two heavyweight processes: the core of Apache daemon (running as `root`) and the Apache deamon with the Eucalyptus shared library loaded (running as `eucalyptus`):

```bash
# ps aux | grep eucalyptus/httpd
root     22526  0.0  0.0  55168  1452 ?        Ss   16:00   0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -f /opt/eucalyptus/etc/eucalyptus/httpd-nc.conf
500      22528  0.2  1.4 2105452 114548 ?      Sl   16:00   0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd -f /opt/eucalyptus/etc/eucalyptus/httpd-nc.conf
```

Attaching `gdb` to the latter will allow one to inspect threads that implement the NC and switch among them:

```bash
# gdb --pid=22528
....
(gdb) info thread
  3 Thread 0x7f601f224700 (LWP 22537)  0x00007f60923e715d in nanosleep () from /lib64/libc.so.6
