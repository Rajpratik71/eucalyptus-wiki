## Introduction

This article explains how to setup openshift origin on a, Fedora 18 instance running on a Eucalyptus private cloud. In order to get Fedora 18 up and running as an instance on Eucalyptus one should follow this article , [Fedora 18 EMI](https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/wiki/Fedora-18-Image)

## Setup

The setup is very simple (POC based), it consists of 1 instance running Fedora 18, this instance would act as both broker as well as node in the openshift setup.

The instance type chosen is m1.xlarge that provides 2CPU/2048MB RAM/20GB of disk, the EMI is bfEBS hence providing persistent disk for root filesystem.

## Installation and Configuration

In order to setup Openshift origin we rely on the [openshift ansible playbook](https://github.com/maxamillion/ansible-openshift_origin)

### Install git and ansible 

On the local machine get ansible and git installed:

```
yum -y install git ansible
```

### Configure ansible hosts

Edit the ansible hosts file (/etc/ansible/hosts) on to add broker and node information

```
[brokers]
10.104.3.10

[nodes]
10.104.3.10
```

Note that 10.104.3.10 is public IP address of the instance, replace with correct settings.

### Get the ansible playbook

```
git clone https://github.com/maxamillion/ansible-openshift_origin.git
```

### Run the ansible playbook

The default login to the instance is as ec2-user , who has sudo privileges, the playbook has user set to root, we would need to modify that in both broker.yml and node.yml

```
sed -i -e 's/user: root/user: ec2-user/g' broker.yml node.yml
```

Next we need to run the following command after changing current working directory to the playbook directory, replace the private key with your environment specific configuration:

```
ansible-playbook --private-key=/home/jeevanullas/sshlogin --user=ec2-user --sudo broker.yml
```

That should do it , and setup the broker.

An output from a sample run in lab is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jeevanullas/5335541#file-openshift-ansible-playbook-broker-output-txt)

Next would be the node, replace the private key with your environment specific configuration:

```
ansible-playbook --private-key=/home/jeevanullas/sshlogin --user=ec2-user --sudo node.yml
```

An output from a sample run in lab is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jeevanullas/5336280#file-openshift-ansible-playbook-node-output-txt)

### Finalizing the install 

* Modify /var/named/example.com.db and replace the private IP with public IP wherever mentioned

* Reboot the instance

## Start using Openshift

This section would walk through verifying the install and then provide example on how to use the openshift origin PaaS

### Verifying the broker

In order to quickly check if broker API endpoint is working, we do the following inside the instance

```
curl -Ik https://localhost/broker/rest/api
```

The output should look something like below

```
HTTP/1.1 200 
Date: Mon, 08 Apr 2013 13:49:28 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.4 (Fedora)
X-Powered-By: Phusion Passenger (mod_rails/mod_rack) 3.0.17
X-UA-Compatible: IE=Edge,chrome=1
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
X-Request-Id: 828a632f548672f76150cf51e726fb9e

ETag: "850315cef2c28482d633170c5877d148"

Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

We can open the console from a web browser, after making sure DNS client points to the DNS server running inside the openshift instance, URL would be:

```
https://broker.example.com/console
```

### Install / Configure rhc

On the local machine , install rhc RPM that provides the client tools to connect to openshift PaaS, one could get the RPM for fedora 18 here [https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/origin-server/nightly/fedora-18/latest/x86_64/ ](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/origin-server/nightly/fedora-18/latest/x86_64/ )

After installing rhc RPM:

```
rhc setup
```

A sample run from lab is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jeevanullas/5338472#file-rhc-setup-txt)

### Setup a demo app

```
rhc app create demoeuca diy-0.1
```

A sample run from lab is available [here](https://gist.github.com/jeevanullas/5338785#file-rhc-app-create-demoeuca-diy-0-1)

Now open in web browser the web page for our demo app

```
https://demoeuca-jeevanullas.app.example.com/
```

DIY or do-it-yourself cartridge allows us to plugin any language support into Openshift, for example C, for more information readers are recommended to read the following [blog post](https://www.openshift.com/blogs/a-paas-that-runs-anything-http-getting-started-with-diy-applications-on-openshift) 

### Install a new cartridge 

One could install a new [cartridge](https://www.openshift.com/faq#t6n11273) on the instance and restart the services to have them available for use, for example let's install a php-5.4 cartridge

```
yum -y install openshift-origin-cartridge-php-5.4
```

After this you should be able to start using php-5.4 in your deployments, by creating a new app using this cartridge

```
rhc app create demopho php-5.4 
```

If for some reason this fails, you could look at clearing the cartridge cache on the instance

```
cd /var/www/openshift/broker 
bundle exec rake tmp:clear
```
