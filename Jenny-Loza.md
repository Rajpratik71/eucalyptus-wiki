Hey Y'all!

I'm the User Experience Architect around here at Eucalyptus Systems...making the world a more usable place, one project at a time. 

Things I think are super cool are:

* Not being afraid of my Native Texan status and inserting Tex-Speak into business communications
* Cooking, and specifically BBQing...my ribs are the stuff dreams are made of, but I'll throw just about anything on there
* Innovative GUI designs that enhance usability while keeping things beautiful and even fun (I'm looking at you, [Cellar](http://cellar-app.com/).) 
* Community contributors to Eucalyptus projects! Especially those who call me Dr. J.Lo
