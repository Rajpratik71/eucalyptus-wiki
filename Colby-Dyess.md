# Colby Dyess
Senior Director of Marketing for Eucalyptus. There was a time I was paid to write code but that was long, long ago. These days when I code, _if I code_, it's for fun.

You may ask yourself, "What's a guy in Marketing doing with a wiki page on git?" 

* Occasionally contributing to non-core services
* Building demos with our partners
* Running local builds
* Trying out pre-release software
