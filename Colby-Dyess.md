# Colby Dyess
I am a Senior Alliances Manager at Eucalyptus. If you'd like to integrate and market your solution with Eucalyptus I'm part of the team that's here to help.  

You may ask yourself, "What's a guy in Marketing doing with a wiki page on git?" 

* Pulling down code
* Running local builds
* Trying out pre-release software
* Building demos with our partners
