# QA system renovation 2013

#### Brain dump of ideas/wishes/hopes/desires (in priority order)
1. Reduce time to get from 0-running setup 
2. Reduce rinse-repeat cycle (rebuilding on same machines)
3. No more memo field
1. run all of our tests (eutester, eutester4j, FOG ..)
4. no more perl
5. Stop calling it QA, it's so much more than that
6. Leverage all work towards 'The system formally known as QA' for a larger test/dev use case. Dog food. This is a common use case, so any work we do towards it should be easily used/extended outside of Eucalyptus. 
7. Set constraints around the design to ensure work going into our test dev system to make sure work is flexible, shareable, ephemeral, etc.. 
8. 'HAVE A DESIGN'
