Hey. My name is Scot and I'm a writer at Eucalyptus. Some facts about me:
* I love documentation and content strategy. 
* From that first point, you can tell that I obviously lead a delightfully dull life.
* I am a fan of the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings, who dash my hopes every year.
* I like to play jazz guitar.

You can contact the documentation team or me if you have questions about contributing content or translating content.
