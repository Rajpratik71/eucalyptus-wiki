## Feature Overview
#### Component level responsibilities
##### ELB Image
##### Servo Process

#### User level operation and tooling
From a user perspective, there is nothing that they need to know about the internal workings of the ELB image or the Servo process that runs in the ELB instance. This is essentially a block box. The only way that users should ever interact with the image/instance is indirectly through the _eulb_ command line tools or through the AWS compatible APIs that Eucalyptus exposes.

## Administrative Tasks
