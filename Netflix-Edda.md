Netflix Edda is a service that polls your AWS resources via AWS APIs and records the results. It allows you to quickly search through your resources and shows you how they have changed over time.  Read more about it at the [Netflix tech blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/11/edda-learn-stories-of-your-cloud.html).

Installation and configuration for use with Eucalyptus still requires a bit of hacking.  For details, see Dan Nurmi's [blog post on the topic](http://nurmiblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/inspired-by-netflix/).
