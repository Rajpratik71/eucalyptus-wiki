Hi, I'm Andy (Also known as [agrimm](http://agrimmsreality.blogspot.com/) or [a13m](https://github.com/a13m)).  I'm a Community Development Engineer at Eucalyptus.  What does that mean, besides spending a lot of time with [Greg DeKoenigsberg](https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/wiki/Greg-DeKoenigsberg)?  Currently, it means:

* watch for pull requests to the Eucalyptus github repo and wrangle those
* manage our issue tracking system and make sure we're being as open as possible about bug & feature discussions
* be involved in technical discussions and projects in the Eucalyptus community
* work on getting Eucalyptus into Fedora 18

I hesitate to call myself an expert on anything, but my areas of focus with respect to Eucalyptus have been:

* Eucalyptus upgrade process (i.e., Groovy and database voodoo)
* Cloud image building (I hack around with ami-creator)
* RPM packaging
* Dealing with dependency updates (See our [Fedora branch](https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commits/maint/3.1/fedora))

Prior to Eucalyptus, I spent 3+ years at rPath in various roles, 18 months at Ingres as the community guy, and 5 years as a Systems Administrator at LexisNexis.

Other fun facts:

* I love baseball, restaurants, coffee, beer, Scrabble, cryptic crosswords, and card games
* I still read a paper newspaper fairly often.  I know it's weird.
