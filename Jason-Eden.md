Greetings. My name is Jason Eden and I manage Technical Services at Eucalyptus Systems, Inc. My current focus is technical customer lifecycle from pre-sales solution engineering through training, certification and consulting - basically, up to the point of successful cloud deployment and hand-off to our Support organization.

My LinkedIn profile is available here:

Some things that might not be obvious on LinkedIn:

* When scheduling allows, I am an activist and advocate for autism-related causes. I have written [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Staging-Miracle-Practical-Surviving-ebook/dp/B0052YYELU/) that details our family's early journey in helping our son overcome the affects of Autism Spectrum Disorder. 

* Like many, many others in the high technology field, I have a B.S. in Psychology, which I followed with an M.B.A., and recently finished up an Associate's of Applied Science in Computer Programming - you know, the standard education track for a cloud tech guy. My ultimate career goal is to apply all of this knowledge as a peanut and beer vendor for a semi-professional sports team.
