Greetings. My name is Jason Eden and I work in Professional Services at Eucalyptus Systems, Inc. My current focus is all things Education, including certification, course development, training delivery, and other sundry tasks.

My LinkedIn profile is available here:

Some things that might not be obvious on LinkedIn:

* When scheduling allows, I am an activist and advocate for autism-related causes. I have written [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Staging-Miracle-Practical-Surviving-ebook/dp/B0052YYELU/) that details our family's early journey in helping our son overcome the affects of Autism Spectrum Disorder. 

* I am a huge fan of St. Louis Cardinals baseball. My apologies to the great state of Texas. I'd feel bad for you, but we have the Rams for football, and I think that about evens things out.

* Like many, many others in the high technology field, I have a B.S. in Psychology, which I followed with an M.B.A., and am now finishing up an Associate's of Applied Science in Computer Programming - you know, the standard education track for a cloud tech guy. My ultimate career goal is to apply all of this knowledge as a peanut and beer vendor for a semi-professional sports team.
